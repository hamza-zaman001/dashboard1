## Technology Stack

Shoppy is built using the following technology stack:

- **Vite:** A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Syncfusion Charts:** Utilized for efficient data visualization.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used for creating a modern and sleek user interface.

## Design Inspiration

The design of Shoppy draws inspiration from various sources on the internet. This inspiration served as a foundation to create an aesthetic and user-friendly interface. Our goal is to provide an enjoyable shopping experience for users.

## Data Integration

To provide a realistic experience, demo data from the internet has been incorporated into the project. JavaScript is used to map this data to the appropriate components within the dashboard. This integration allows us to showcase the functionality of the various pages, such as orders, employees, customers, charts, and theme settings.

## Pages

The dashboard contains the following pages:

1. **Ecommerce:** This page is the central hub for managing products, categories, and other e-commerce-related activities.

2. **Sidebar:** The sidebar provides quick navigation to various sections of the dashboard, making it easy to switch between different functionalities.

3. **Orders:** Manage and track customer orders, view order details, and update order status.

4. **Employees:** Handle employee information, roles, and permissions.

5. **Customers:** Keep track of customer data and interactions, making it easier to provide a personalized shopping experience.

6. **Charts:** Utilize Syncfusion Charts to visualize sales data, trends, and performance metrics.

7. **Theme Settings:** Customize the appearance and behavior of the dashboard to suit your preferences.
